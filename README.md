# Evercore
 A modified version of [Smalleste](https://github.com/CelesteClassic/smalleste) with support for scrolling levels and mapdata string loading.

 Evercore uses a completely reworked level system: Rather than simply loading rooms using coordinates, Evercore uses a table of level strings, each containing the coordinates, size, and name of the level.
